The `sum` connector can be used to sum numerical values from spans, span events, metrics, data points, and log records. The sum is then 
sent as a metric.
## Configuration

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first visit the [Connectors README].

### Default Configuration

The `sum` connector requires configuration settings for at least `source_attribute` be defined.  

#### Source_attribute (required)
`source_attribute` defines the attribute to look for numerical data in that will then be summed and turned into 
a metric time series.

For example, in the following configuration the connector will sum numerical data from the `some.attribute` log attribute from the `logs/in`
pipeline and emit a metric called `metric.name.of.your.choice` onto the `metrics/out` pipeline.

```yaml
receivers:
  foo:
connectors:
  sum:
    logs:
      metric.name.of.your.choice:
        source_attribute: 
          - attributes["some.attribute"]
exporters:
  bar:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/out:
       receivers: [sum]
       exporters: [bar]
    logs/in:
       receivers: [foo]
       exporters: [sum]
```

### Custom Sums

Optionally, emit custom sums by defining metrics under one or more of the following sections:

- `spans`
- `spanevents`
- `metrics`
- `datapoints`
- `logs` 


#### Conditions

Conditions may be specified for custom metrics. If specified, data that matches any one
of the conditions will be summed. i.e. Conditions are ORed together.

```yaml
receivers:
  foo:
connectors:
  sum:
    logs:
      metric.name.of.your.choice:
        source_attribute: 
          - attributes["some.attribute"]
        conditions:
          - attributes["some.attribute"] != "NULL"
exporters:
  bar:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/out:
       receivers: [sum]
       exporters: [bar]
    logs/in:
       receivers: [foo]
       exporters: [sum]
```

#### Attributes

`spans`, `spanevents`, `datapoints`, and `logs` may also include other attributes from the source data.

If attributes are specified for custom metrics, a separate sum will be generated for each unique
set of attribute values. Each sum will be emitted as a data point on the same metric.

Optionally, include a `default_value` for an attribute, to sum data that does not contain the attribute. The `default_value` value can be of type string, integer, or float.

```yaml
receivers:
  foo:
connectors:
  sum:
    logs:
      metric.name.of.your.choice:
        source_attribute: 
          - attributes["some.attribute"]
        attributes:
          - key: env
            default_value: no_value
exporters:
  bar:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/out:
       receivers: [sum]
       exporters: [bar]
    logs/in:
       receivers: [foo]
       exporters: [sum]
```
